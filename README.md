## Data Analysis Project (Work in progress)
I am currently self-studying SQL querying and database management as well as data visualisation with Power BI and various Python libraries for data analysis such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.  I am aiming to complete a project that demonstrates my understanding of these skills.
